# Execution Plans

Use this directory for durable execution plans that span multiple sessions,
contributors, or worktrees.

Current active planning set:

- [Full-System Architecture Scorecard Roadmap](architecture-scorecard-roadmap.md)
  - scoring and prioritization entrypoint for full-repo architecture quality
- [Architecture And Harness Cleanup Roadmap](architecture-harness-cleanup.md)
  - active execution roadmap for architecture and harness cleanup tracks
- [L4 Paths And Herd Roadmap](l4-paths-herd-roadmap.md)
  - active product and runtime roadmap for Mother-led Paths, Steps,
    Checkpoints, Herds, and long-running work
- [macOS Full Regression Acceptance](macos-full-regression-acceptance.md)
  - active acceptance plan for real packaged macOS app, model-backed UX,
    Personal Model memory, and native desktop workflow coverage
- [Context Engineering Optimization Plan](context-engineering-research.md)
  - follow-up tracks from the context-engineering research pass, with explicit
    write scopes for scorecard, long-horizon evals, recall diagnostics,
    compaction quality, prompt-cache stability, and tool-output pressure
  - synchronized Chinese companion:
    [context-engineering-research.zh-CN.md](context-engineering-research.zh-CN.md)

Rules:

- keep only one active roadmap for the same subsystem
- move architecture prose to `docs/system-design/`
- delete superseded plans instead of preserving competing legacy designs
